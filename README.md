# Data Analyst Job Market Dashboard (Excel)

This is my first time using Excel, and this dashboard is also my very first Excel project. I created it to apply the skills Iâ€™ve just learned and to explore how Excel can be used to analyze real-world data.

# Project Purpose
This project was created as a way for me to apply and reinforce what Iâ€™ve recently learned in Excel. It focuses on building a functional and insightful dashboard using only core Excel features.

# Skills Demonstrated

In this project, I focused on using only basic Excel features:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Charts** â€“ for visualizing salary distribution
- ðŸ“‹ **Formulas and Functions** â€“ to calculate things like median salary and job counts,...
- âœ… **Data Validation** â€“ to build interactive filters

No pivot table, macro or advanced tools were used â€” this project is all about mastering the basics while trying to deal with a large number of data

# Dataset

The dataset used contains real-world information about data science job postings from 2023. It was made publicly available by Luke Barousse:
